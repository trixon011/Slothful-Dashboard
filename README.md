✨ About This Project
   This dashboard represents my first step into the world of data visualization and business intelligence. I created it to understand how Power BI works—from loading data and cleaning it, to building visuals and     arranging them into a meaningful layout.
   It’s a simple project, but it reflects my effort to learn, experiment, and grow my analytical skills. I plan to keep updating this repository as I explore more advanced features and build better dashboards        over time.
